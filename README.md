# TicTacToe-game
##Features:

###1)Multi player mode : Two players play against each other.
###2)Single player mode : User play against an implemented smart
 algorithm that tries to win the game, this mode has to levels:
  a-hard level (unbeaten) if the program starts first.
  b-easy level if the user starts first.
  
but how can we decide who will start the user or the program?!
###3)Rock Paper Scissor : a fast simple game to decide who will start first


##The game will accept these inputs from the user:

###->an input to choose between the two modes
###->names of the players

decide the positions which will increase his winning opportunities.


##Tools:
